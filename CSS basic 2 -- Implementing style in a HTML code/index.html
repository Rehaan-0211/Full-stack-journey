    Yes...that's my name. Since the whole year I have been trying to completely spend myself doing web development and finally make websites out of it but because of family problems and also my mistakes...I wasn't able to continue in long term..but this time..let's finish it for good.
  </p>
  <h2>My goals</h2>
  <p>
    For many this may sound delusional and hopeless but I aspire to finish my full stack journey within 2 months...and I will make it happen no matter what...with all the AI tools I have and my dedication..I'll make it happen üòä.
  </p>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    Before starting to work full time on my skills my hobby was to play games...a lot. Cause it was the only thing I felt relieved from...escaping the fact that my life is actually finishing after every move I make in those games...I still do like games a lot but for my future..I'll have to say goodbye. Anyways here's a list of my hobbies:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Gaming</li>
    <li>Football</li>
    <li>Social Media</li>
    <li>Reading</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In short my hobbies brought little to no value...and I'll change that.</p>
